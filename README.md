# Deloitte Data Analytics Virtual Experience Program – Forage

This repository contains my completed tasks from the **Deloitte Data Analytics Virtual Internship** hosted on [Forage](https://www.theforage.com/), which simulates real-world data analyst responsibilities in a consulting environment.

## 📁 Project Overview

As part of this virtual experience, I worked on two key tasks for a fictional Deloitte client, **Daikibo Industrials**:

### Task 1: Factory Telemetry Analysis
- Tools Used: **Tableau**
- Objective: Analyze machine telemetry data from four global factories.
- Key Deliverables:
  - Created a calculated field ("Unhealthy") to measure machine downtime.
  - Built interactive dashboards:
    - **Down Time per Factory**
    - **Down Time per Device Type**
  - Used factory-level filtering to investigate problem areas.

### Task 2: Gender Pay Equality Assessment
- Tools Used: **Microsoft Excel**
- Objective: Assess fairness in compensation across different job roles and factory locations.
- Key Deliverables:
  - Classified equality scores into:
    - **Fair**
    - **Unfair**
    - **Highly Discriminative**
  - Added visual analysis for HR and leadership decision-making.
